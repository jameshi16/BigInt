# Big INT C++
A noobish attempt at implementing huge numbers in C++, created by [James](https://www.github.com/jameshi16).

## What is Big Int?
A normal `int` in C++ can store a maximum of 2,147,483,647 and a minimum of -2,147,483,648. This implementation of BigInt is designed to theoretically store any numbers, no matter how big or small.

The basic mathematical operators are also implemented, so you can use them like a normal integer! (Almost)
